# DeafGrandma App

### Description
The Deaf Grandma App is a simple Java console application that simulates a conversation with a hard-of-hearing grandma. Users can type messages to Grandma, who will respond randomly based on whether or not she can hear them. The user has to type in all caps in order for Grandma to be able to hear. The app continues until the user types "GOODBYE," at which point Grandma will offer a farewell response. 

### Technologies Used 
Java: The game is implemented in Java, making use of basic constructs such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

JDK (Java Development Kit): Required to compile and run the Java application

Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Eclipse

### Lessons Learned
String manipulation: Implementing logic to detect whether the user is "shouting" by checking if the input is in uppercase.


Random response generation: Using the Random class to pick random responses from predefined arrays of affirmative, negative, and farewell responses.


Control flow: Managing different response paths based on user input and properly ending the conversation when the user says "GOODBYE."


Switch-case logic: Efficiently managing different types of responses (affirmative, negative, farewell) using a switch statement.
